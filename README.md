# capstone-project

The purpose of this project at a broad level is to understand the connections between music and mental health outcomes. The data in my Capstone comes from two sources, the first being a Kaggle dataset consisting of survey submissions with self reported mental health scores and musical listening habits. The second comes from Spotify, which contains songs and their characteristics, including genres, energy levels, keys, etc.
